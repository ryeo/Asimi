# Asimi

Asimi is a bot based on [Arduino](http://arduino.cc), which I created to experiment with robotics and different ways to connect to external interfaces from Arduino.

## The name Asimi

I choose the name Asimi, in honour of [Isaac Asimov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov), who coined the term 'robotics'. Also 'A' is the starting letter of the name of a very special person in my life ;) 

## Modules

Each module is a separate Arduino Sketch which does a particular functionality. Right now the following modules are available.

*   BasicBot
*   WiiBottonsBot
*   WiiAcclerometerBot
*   AndroidControlledBot

## Installation

Download the project. Copy the folder inside the libraries folder into the Arduino Library folder. Open the projects in Arduino IDE and you should be able to compile them. 

The Android project can be opened in Eclipse.
